\Chapter{Installing and loading the package}

The package can be downloaded from
\URL{https://gap-packages.github.io/sglppow/}

Then `tar -zxvf slgppow.tar' produces a directory `sglppow'. This should be
moved into the pkg directory of a GAP installation.

The package is set up so that after loading it into GAP with `LoadPackage("sglppow")'
the full functionality of the package is available.
